## 1. My last year in School of Economics

The year was 2019, and as an economics student on the verge of graduating from the School of Economics at Lund University, I faced professional uncertainty. The dream of working at an investment bank with its enticing salaries and big deals was there, but the long working hours and the competitive, status-driven environment seemed to threaten my personal well-being. Moreover, the industry showed signs of stagnation.

## 2. Pivoting Towards Technology

My economics studies, spanning topics such as accounting and marketing, seemed to primarily lead to jobs that required prolonged career ladders dependent on networking. Climbing the career ladder as an auditor or controller did not appeal to me. The IT world, with its innovation and constant development, resonated with my desire to be in continuous learning and growth. There was a high demand for skills and attractive starting salaries. A tech startup was my dream, and to approach it, I began transforming my background in economics into technical expertise.

## 3. Taking the Leap into IT

That same year, I took a leap and started an intensive course in Java programming, which quickly led to a position as an IT consultant. When the pandemic hit in 2020 and the economy was shaken, I found myself in a stable and growing career as a testing engineer at Sigma Connectivity. My career accelerated, and I secured a permanent position at House of Test with a significant salary increase. I also achieved one of my financial goals by purchasing an apartment in Gamla Väster and securing a mortgage that leveraged my capital.

## 4. Embracing Independence

I have been on my journey in the IT industry for four years. I have leveled up each year. As a self-employed individual, I can no longer level up. In 2023, I made the decision to start my own consulting company. In many ways, I have reached the final destination as an IT consultant; becoming a freelancer.

## 5. At a Crossroads

But shortly after resigning, I realized the enthusiasm I had expected was missing. Despite the financial opportunities, I found myself feeling a lack of vision. I was facing a new path, but what it leads to is still unclear.

## 6. Contemplating a New Direction

The drive I had during 2019-2020 has gradually diminished, and today I am uncertain if I want to continue as an IT consultant in my own company. I am considering changing my career path. I feel that I want to do something independently. A vision of my own. At the same time, I am not sure if I am willing to sacrifice my well-being for my own tech startup. The risks are too great.

## 7. Envisioning a Balanced Future

I have considered becoming an author on subjects I am passionate about, which are interdisciplinary and always true. To package information for a new audience and to
publish and distribute it. Additionally, I can earn money by renting out my apartment in Gamla Väster to tourists during the summers and living in my allotment garden cottage. I am beginning to visualize a lifestyle where I am not dependent on anyone else's schedule. Where I can create at my own pace and respect my need for balance.
